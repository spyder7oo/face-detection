# face-detection

This program wil detect your face in your webcam feed using opencv and harr cascades.

Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location. This algorithm is not so complex and can run in real-time. We can train a haar-cascade detector to detect various objects like cars, bikes, buildings, fruits, etc.
